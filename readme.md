Hey ðŸ‘‹ My name is Tobias SchottstÃ¤dt and I am a full-stack web developer.

My main focus is on application development, which I mainly realize with the programming languages PHP and Javascript. The frameworks Laravel and Vue.JS or Livewire are used for this.


I have also been working on my hobby project ITTagesschau since 2015

Anyone who likes to keep up to date with current events in the IT world and wants to keep up with the times knows the problem: having to have lots of news websites on your screen. This is what the site was created for.

ITTagesschau is an IT news collection of the best IT news, always up-to-date and centralized.
