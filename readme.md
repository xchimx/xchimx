Hey ðŸ‘‹ My name is [Tobias SchottstÃ¤dt](https://www.schottstaedt.net/) and I am a full-stack web developer.

My main focus is on application development, which I mainly realize with the programming languages PHP and Javascript. The frameworks Laravel and Vue.JS or Livewire are used for this.


I have also been working on my hobby project ITTagesschau since 2015

Anyone who likes to keep up to date with current events in the IT world knows the problem: too many news websites on your screen. This is what the site was created for.

[ITTagesschau](https://www.ittagesschau.de/) is an IT news collection of the best IT news, always up-to-date and centralized.
